3) Why do you want to learn how to program?
In the words of the great Kanye West, "we live in a society". But seriously, the world of 2018 has computing tools in every field and aspect of life. Personally, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with life but I want to improve some aspect of the world, and CS leaves me flexible to really create something new with whatever problem I encounter with in the future. At least that's my idea of CS, maybe EECS classes here would show me otherwise. I'm ready to learn.
